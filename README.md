# Hangman-Python
Tiny freetime project to try our string usage.

This have been in my Github for awhile now and I just realized the code didn't run as intended. I fixed the issue today 22/01/2023. 

Very raw version of a hangman game. First put in a word and then try to quess it hangman style. I should add better UI and perhaps a list of words to pick one randomly for funnier experience.
